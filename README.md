Watch-List Creation Application
This application has allowed me to work with a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and implement a structured MVC architecture.

Objective
The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly application for managing personalized movie lists. Users can create lists with custom names, upload images for their lists, add movies from a pre-registered database, leave comments on movies, and efficiently manage their lists by adding or deleting movies as needed.
